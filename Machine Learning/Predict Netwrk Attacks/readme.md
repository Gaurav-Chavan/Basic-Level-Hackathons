# Multiclass-Classification-to-Predict-Network-Attack
       This project was a part of Hacker-Earth Challenge. The training dataset contained features and class labels as type of network attack viz. Type 0,Type 1, Type 2.  The training dataset was filtered by removing near zero variance and highly correlated attributes. Also, RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) technique was used to Identify the important attributes in training dataset.           XGBOOST model was used with proper tuning to get 96% accuracy over test set.
