their portfolio returns. Think of a portfolio as a basket. The basket can contain diverse instruments such as equity stocks,
debentures, mutual funds etc. Each portfolio is allotted to portfolio managers. 
Intelligence about future performance would help these portfolio managers to act and take necessary steps in order to overcome losses. 
In this challenge, given the randomly sampled data, you’ve to predict the portfolio’s annual returns. 
Keeping data privacy in mind, some of the variables have been anonymised.
