Given dataset contains a total of 17 columns labeled A-P, out of which A-O columns are the features and column P is the label. Column “id” specifies a unique number for every row.

The job was to build a machine learning model to predict column P using all or some of the feature columns.

The submission should be a csv file stating id along with the predicted label.
