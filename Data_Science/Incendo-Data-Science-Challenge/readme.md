# Incendo-Data-Science-Challenge

This Data Science Challenge was focused on leveraging NLP to build Machine Learning Models.

There were two challenges:

1.  Prediction of Addiction Probability to drug:  where based on users demographic and questionnaire data we needed to predict users likeliness to being addicted to drug.

2.  Automatic Script Evaluator : In this problem, goal was to rank essays based on content in it. Training data was provided so used DTM to build predictive model.
