We wrote a shell script, so that the device runs the source code as soon as it starts up on bootup.
The name of shell script is given as launcher.sh so that system recognizes it to be loaded on boot time.

In this script we just add the path where source code to run  is stored, save it and reboot the machine.
  cd /
  cd home/pi/program
  sudo python Sense_Logger_v4.py
  cd /
